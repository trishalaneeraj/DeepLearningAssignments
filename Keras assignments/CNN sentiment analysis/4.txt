Agent: Good afternoon. TBH Network Solutions. 
Customer: Yeah, hi. My system is down and I need to speak with a technician. 
Agent: Oh, okay. Let me gather some information and see if we can help. What is your first name? 
Customer: Fred. 
Agent: And your last name; would you spell it for me please? Fred Sure. It’s C-H-A-M-B-E-R-S, Chambers. 
Agent: Okay. And your company name? 
Customer: I’m with GoldStar Environmental. 
Agent: GoldStar Environmental?
Customer: Yes ma’am.
Agent: Okay. And your callback number? 
Customer: 610-265-1715. 
Agent: That’s 610-265-1715? 
Customer: Yes. 
Agent: Okay. And what seems to be the problem today? 
Customer: My agents aren’t able to make or receive any telephone calls. 
Agent: Okay and what type of system do you have. Fred I have AmStar700, I think. Emily Okay. Are you able to log on to the system?
Customer: No, actually, I can’t even get an Internet connection. 
Agent: Okay. According to my records, the AmStar700 is a voiceover Internet protocol phone. It appears that because your Internet isn’t working, your phones are not working as well. Do you know who your Internet provider is? 
Customer: I have Verizon. 
Agent: Okay. Mr. Chambers, I’m going to get a hold of Randy, and have him return your call. Is the 610-265-1715 a good number to reach you at right now?
Customer: Yeah that’s my cell. That is working. 
Agent: Okay, great. In the meantime, see if you can reach out to Verizon and let them know your issue. And Randy should be calling you back shortly. 
Customer: Thank you very much for your help. 
Agent: You’re welcome. Thank you. Goodbye. Fred Take care. Goodbye.
